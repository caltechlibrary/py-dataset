# Installing dataset Python module

## From Source code

_dataset_ is available to Python 3.6 based on a C shared library derived from the _dataset_ Go package. If you want to 
compile from scratch you need to have Go 1.10, GNU Make and Python 3.6 installed.  Running make will compile 
an appropriate shared library for your platform and place the shared library in the module directory
(e.g. libdataset.so, libdataset.dll, or libdataset.dylib).  After this is done you can then run
the standard `python3 setup.py install --user` to install the package on to your system.
